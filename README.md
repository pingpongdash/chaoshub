This is a very unreliable framework created by a drunk person.

Though it claims to be a framework, it's essentially just a collection of hastily written scripts.

Expect unexpected behaviors, and don’t take anything too seriously. It's perfect for those who enjoy a challenge or want to experiment with the unpredictable.

Use it at your own risk, and remember: the creator had a little too much to drink when putting this together!
